# Mudae Wish Series Discord Bot Alternative
 
## What language does it use?
- This code was written in python.

## Where can I run this code for my discord bot?
- I ran this code on replit for free, you can also host it yourself.

## Why did you create this code?
- This code was created a while ago. After spending well over $200 as a server, we decided to create a bot for the Wish Series premium function, though we only did it for a month.

## Why isnt the code working?
- You need to change a few things on your end before it can start working. Make sure to add the correct discord user and channel IDs to their proper spots and that you created and connected the correct discord bot token. Or maybe I messed up.

## This code can be done alot better.
- I completely agree, in its current state, it was something I had created quickly for those in my server.

## Does this code only work for its sole purpose?
- Of course not. You can modify the code to detect any set of words or phrases someone may say in your server. You can keep it as an embed for its sole purpose, or change it to all messages and have some fun with word detection :)

## When was this code created?
- This code was created back in 2021, so if there are any changes in the Discord Code, I will adjust it in the future (or you will, here is the documentation https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html )
